# Kopi Organic Roastery

## Overview

In this project, I designed and developed a website for an imaginary coffee brand, Kopi Organic Roastery. The goal was to create an interactive list-based interface where users are able to select and aggregate items. Users are able to browse, filter, and sort through Kopi's signature coffee offerings and add them to cart.
