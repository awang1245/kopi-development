# Kopi Organic Roastery

## Overview

In this project, I designed and developed a website for my imagined coffee brand, Kopi Organic Roastery. The goal was to create an interactive list-based interface where users are able to select and aggregate items. Users can browse, filter, and sort through Kopi's signature coffee offerings and add them to their carts.
